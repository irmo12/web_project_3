# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

In this project I employ techs for adaptive web design. A website to showcase the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees, and my own.
I had to implement css grid layouts, media queries and relative values where comfortable to achieve smooth and consistent display across the spectrum of device widths specified.
